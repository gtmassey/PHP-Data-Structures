# PHP Data Structures

This project stems from my returning to school for a degree in computer science. Originally, I took a Data Structures and Algorithms course in my first degree program, and I struggled with some of the concepts. 

One unrelated degree and several years later, I now work as a programmer full time, and I am going back to school to finish what I started with CS. This project is a personal exploration of data structures in the language I am most familiar with, PHP.

At some point, plans to create a data structures package will come to fruition, but for now I will keep the code for the project here and make semi-regular updates to the classes when I have time.
